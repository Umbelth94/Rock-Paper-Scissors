# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is the first real javascript application that I made with guidance from The Odin Project.  

Initially, it ran via the console, but once I learned more about DOM manipulation, the goal became to create a fully functioning application utilizing buttons and a text interface to provide feedback to the user.  

# Features
* 3 Seperate 'windows' between the "Start game", "Rounds Input", and "Game Window"
* Ability to select how many rounds the user would like to play to.
* Auto play feature that will simulate the game by randomly choosing for the player
* Rounds history button that populates a chart for each round's results.  

# To Do:
* Find a better way to organize the window, and color code the results of each match.  (Green if player wins, red if player loses, etc.) 

Thanks for checking it out,

Travis
