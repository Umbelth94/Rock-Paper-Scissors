# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This will be the first javaScript program that I write from scratch.  I will be attempting to create a basic javaScript implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" childhood game.  Later on, I will be utilising ways to add a graphical and UI element to it all.  The goal of this exercise is to simply create a functioning version of the game.
